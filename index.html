      <h2>About me</h2>


      <p>I come from a family of four,having only one sibbling and both parents alive.We live in Utawala-Nairobi.</p>
      <p>I was born in 1998 in the month of December,date 11th and attended various schools throughout my journey in education as follows upto now:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary school-Busara Forest View Academy</li>
        <li>Secondary School-Nyahururu Elite Schools</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Aside from all that, i also have various interests.My current interests include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coding</li>
        <li>Watching animations and music videos</li>
        <li>Interacting and getting to know different kinds of people</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The main reason I chose to do coding and mainly at <strong>Moringa School</strong> is because I have an interest in knowing how different software programs are created and how they work.</p>
      <p>Besides, I would also like to come up with a software program some day!</p>
      <p>I chose to come to Moringa School because compared to other coding schools, I know it to be the best.It is human nature for everyone to want the best.</p>
